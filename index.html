        <dt>Background</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                I was born in Taichung, Taiwan, but my hometown is Yunlin, Taiwan.<br>
                I am pretty grateful to be in a harmonic family of four.
                My dad works as a doctor in the hospital, and my lovely mom teaches high school physics.
                I have one brother, who is 3-year younger than me; he is a freshman in
                National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, majoring in mechanical engineering.

        <dt>Current interests</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Participating in competitive programming contests and designing websites are two of my main
                interests.<br>
                By participating in various contest, either on-site or online, I feel like I can grasp algorithmic
                concepts and
                data structures more firmly and quickly. Also, applying knowledge in real problem sets makes me feel
                more energetic
                while learning.<br>
                Designing websites is a completely different scenario, though. Coming up with products that can help
                people
                improve their quality of work, or providing people with more convenient and cozy life is the main
                driving
                force of my interest
                in developing them.

        <dt>Future goals</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Future is a very uncertain and vague phrase. So I would like to talk about my plan for the upcoming year
                instead.<br>

                Develop and maintain the CCULife app for iOS system, which is written by a wonderful post-graduate
                student,
                who is currently studying at CCU, will be my primary goal. The app has received many positive feedback,
                but due to lack of time of the app creator,
                the development has been halted for quite some time. I plan to fix the known bugs and introduce new
                features in the near future!
